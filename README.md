Always test random PowerShell Functions you download from the Internet in an environment you can afford to wipe and rebuild.

I am not a PowerShell 'expert' by any stretch of the imagination, I am just bumbling my way along a journey and these functions make my life a little easier!

Feel free to use anything you find here; please just don't come crying if it does something you didn't expect or want.

Open an issue if you have questions or suggestions and I will get back to you at some point in the future.

Enjoy
